### [This AI Bot Fills Out Job Applications for You While You Sleep](https://www.wired.com/story/this-ai-bot-fills-out-job-applications-for-you-while-you-sleep/)

I found this article interesting because it introduces a software that will automatically apply for jobs. I think this is program would be really beneficial since applying to jobs is mundane and repetitive. I think it is interesting to consider the ethics of the software and how some believe it is not ethical and how others think there is nothing wrong with it.

Yes! I think AI-powered job applications are both exciting and concerning. On one hand, automating applications could help job seekers save time and increase their chances of landing interviews. But on the other hand, it could make the hiring process even more impersonal and overwhelming for employers. If both applicants and companies use AI, it raises the question: are we losing the human element in hiring? Itâ€™s a fascinating debate about efficiency versus authenticity.
