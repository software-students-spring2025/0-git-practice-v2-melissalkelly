### [This AI Bot Fills Out Job Applications for You While You Sleep](https://www.wired.com/story/this-ai-bot-fills-out-job-applications-for-you-while-you-sleep/)

I found this article interesting because it introduces a software that will automatically apply for jobs. I think this is program would be really beneficial since applying to jobs is mundane and repetitive. I think it is interesting to consider the ethics of the software and how some believe it is not ethical and how others think there is nothing wrong with it.

What I find interetsing about this article is how AI tools like LazyApply 
can automate the job application process, saving time, but still struggles 
with finding perfect job matches, hightlighting the balance between 
efficiency and quality in job searching. I think it shows how technology 
is reshaping traditiional job hunting, even though human connections and 
networking remain important.
